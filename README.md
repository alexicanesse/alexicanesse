## Projects 🚀

Here are some highlighted projects from my GitHub repositories:

1. **Basic-Encoder-cGAN**: A simple cGAN made using an auto-encoder.
   - [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alexicanesse/Basic-Encoder-cGAN)
   - Description: This repository showcases a minimalist yet effective implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing MNIST digits. It uses the GAN's generator as a decoder of an autoencoder which enable use to produce guided outputs.
   - Technologies Used: PyTorch.

2. **NEMU---A-NES-Emulator**:
   - [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alexicanesse/NEMU---A-NES-Emulator)
   - Description: A complete NES emulator made from scratch. Mainly intended as a tool for learning computer architecture. It is my first complete C++ project.
   - Technologies Used: full C++.

3. **Chinese Checkers solver**: A solver for the two player Chinese Checkers game.
   - [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alexicanesse/ChineseCheckers)
   - Description: This project is a solver for two players' Chinese Checkers game using the Alpha Beta pruning algorithm. The program is written in C++ and uses a number of heuristics to improve the performance of the algorithm. The Chinese Checkers solver program has been built with performance in mind.
   - Technologies Used: C++ for backend and Python for frontend.
